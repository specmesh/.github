# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security vulnerabilities will be 'fixed forward', i.e. the vulnerability will be patched in a new release.
If you require a specific version to be patched, please get in touch by creating a [support discussion](https://github.com/orgs/specmesh/discussions/new?category=support)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by 
[privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) 
in either the GitHub repository containing the issue, or in the [Organisational .github repository](https://github.com/specmesh/.github/security/advisories/new).

## Timings

SpecMesh is an open-source project maintained by volunteers. As such, we offer no hard and fast guarantees on response times. 
However, we aim to respond to all questions and issues within 7 days, and would obviously treat security issues with a higher priority.
